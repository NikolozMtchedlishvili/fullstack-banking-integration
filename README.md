# fullstack-banking-integration

## Overview
This project was built to address a real-world accessibility problem faced by small neighborhood grocery stores. Many local retailers lack digital infrastructure, limiting their reach and unintentionally excluding elderly or less mobile customers.

I developed a **fully functional e-commerce prototype** that enables local stores to sell products online, accept digital payments, and offer delivery services. The platform is designed to be scalable and adaptable for multiple neighborhood retailers with minimal customization. I integrated Bank of Georgia Payments API to handle digital payments and QuickShipper for delivery services.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Payments: Bank of Georgia Payments API (sandbox)
- Delivery: QuickShipper API (sandbox)
- Storage: JSON (demo), scalable to DB

## Problem Statement
Small grocery stores in my country are often operated by farmers or family owners with limited technical or business education. As a result:
- Customers face barriers to purchasing essential goods
- Stores lose potential revenue
- Communities suffer from reduced access to healthy food

This project bridges the gap between **local retailers and their customers** by providing a simple, accessible online storefront.

## Backend
The backend is built with **Node.js** and handles:
- Order creation and management
- Payment processing
- Delivery coordination
- Admin functionality

All sensitive information such as API keys and real customer data has been removed from the public repository.

## Frontend
The frontend is designed to be built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on:
- Simplicity and accessibility
- Ease of use for non-technical store owners
- Clear product presentation and ordering flow

---

## Roadmap & Business Considerations
The project is currently work in progress. With improvements to be done on the frontend, especially design.

Apart from frontend and backend, I must come up with:
- Payment commission models
- Delivery pricing strategies
- Minimal-fee structures for affordability

To maximize my outreach to target audience and create value for both business parties and customers.

The long-term vision is to scale this solution to multiple local retailers in different neighborhoods or cities.
